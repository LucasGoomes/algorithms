# algorithms
Welcome to the Algorithms Repository! This repository contains a collection of algorithms developed as part of the "Projects and Algorithm Automation" course at PUCRS.

## Table of Contents
- [Greedy Algorithms](#greedy-algorithms)

## Usage

Each algorithm has its own directory with its implementation. In each algorithm's directory, you will find the source code and an explanation of how the algorithm works. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your own use.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you've implemented a new algorithm or improved an existing one, please consider submitting a pull request.

**Note:** This repository is a work in progress and will be continuously updated with more algorithms and explanations as the course progresses. Currently, the repository contains mainly greedy algorithms, but more algorithm categories will be added over time. Stay tuned for more updates!
